INSTALLATION

FIRST RUN

Start the bot by typing "./dasbit". At start, none of the supplied plugins is
enabled by default, so you have to enable them. First you have to become the
bot master, so start a query with the bot and type "!master". This command only
works once and will authenticate you with your NickServ username, so be sure to
be identified with it. After you are authenticated, you can enable the different
plugins with "!plugin enable <plugin-name>".
